This paper presents Maverick, a proof-of-concept computer-aided design (CAD) flow for generating reconfigurable modules (RMs) which target partial reconfiguration (PR) regions in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) designs.
After an initial static design and PR region are created with Xilinx's Vivado PR flow, the Maverick flow can then compile and configure RMs onto that PR region---without the use of vendor tools. 
Maverick builds upon existing open source tools (Yosys, RapidSmith2, and Project X-Ray) to form an end-to-end compilation flow.
This paper describes the Maverick flow and shows the results of it running on a PYNQ-Z1's ARM processor to compile a set of HDL designs to partial bitstreams.
The resulting bitstreams were configured onto the PYNQ-Z1's FPGA fabric, demonstrating the feasibility of a single-chip embedded system which can both compile HDL designs to bitstreams and then configure them onto its own programmable fabric.
